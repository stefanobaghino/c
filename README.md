# The C Programming Language

## Examples and solutions

Code from and solutions to exercises from "The C Programming Language" (2nd edition) by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie.

The small utility script `c` is provided to compile and run individual source files, e.g.:

    ./c hello.c

Will compile the `hello.c` file, put the compiler output under the `out` subdirectory and run it, resulting in the dear old

    hello, world

If things are not going your way, you can compile and debug with the `d` script, e.g.:

    ./d hello.c
